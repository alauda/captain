Captain is a Helm 3 Controller


![](./docs/imgs/captain-arc-2.png)


## About Helm3 

This project is based on the core [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) v3 code, acting as a library. Some modifications were made to help implement this controller on a fork: [alauda/helm](https://github.com/alauda/helm) .

## Features
* HelmRequest/ChartRepo/Release CRD, namespace based
* Git/Svn as ChartRepo
* Local ChartRepo based on ChartMuseum
* Multi cluster support based on [cluster-registry](https://github.com/kubernetes/cluster-registry)
* Dependency check for HelmRequest (between HelmRequests)
* `valuesFrom` support: support to ConfigMap or Secret value store
* `kubectl apply` like resource manipulation: no more resource conflict and CRD management issues
* OCI chart support
* HTTP downloadable chart support


## Quick Start
Check the [Installation Guide](./docs/en/install.md) to learn how to install captain

Then, create a HelmRequest resource 

```yaml
kind: HelmRequest
apiVersion: app.alauda.io/v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
spec:
  chart: stable/nginx-ingress
```
After a few seconds, you have an nginx-ingress chart running

```bash
root@VM-16-12-ubuntu:~/demo# kubectl get pods
NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-ingress-controller-57987f445c-9rhv5        1/1     Running   0          16s
nginx-ingress-default-backend-7679dbd5c9-wkkss   1/1     Running   0          16s
root@VM-16-12-ubuntu:~/demo# kubectl get hr
NAME            CHART                  VERSION   NAMESPACE   ALLCLUSTER   PHASE    AGE
nginx-ingress   stable/nginx-ingress             default                  Synced   23s
```
