## Why captain?

Well, although helm is widely used in the kubernetes world, , it's still limited by it's nature as a cli tool. For 
nowadays, the standard way to extend kubernetes functionality is using CRD and the controller pattern. In Helm 3 's design 
doc, it talk about this kind of integration, but not a import one. So we create Captain to not only fill out our own needs,
but to explore this kind of possibility for the community.


## Who is using captain?
The first customer is oneself, of course. It's been widely used in our environment, and replace helm2/3 for the most cases. 
We also have a few of enterprise customers in China, they use REST API to integration captain to there systems. It works 
very well
